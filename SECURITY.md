# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Individual projects within the site will be at different points in a development lifecycle. Discovered vulnerabilities, however, may apply to the architecture or library not just to a specific project; so any apparent vulnerability must be assessed.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| any     | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Before it has been examined and assessed, please do not publish or disclose specific information about any software vulnerability by any public means, whether by discussing in chat rooms, mailing lists or other open forums. In discussing vulnerabilities in general, take care to consider your (immediate and eventual) audiences as well as how you characterize problems, risks, defenses and solutions.

However, this caution does not extend to clear bugs and failures in the software, i.e. where problems emerge not because systems are compromised but because they simply do not work as intended.

If you feel your case does not fall into the category of bugs, functional lapses and feature requests, or is for any reason inappropriate for a public forum such as the [Issues board[(issues), please contact the [code owners](CODEOWNERS) directly.
