# Testing the OSCAL Inspector XSLT

OSCAL Inspector XSLT is an application of InspectorXSLT, a component of the metaschema-xslt data validation and processing framework.

Testing in this repository constitutes a two-fold test:

- Testing the InspectorXSLT application - 'field testing' Inspector XSLT on OSCAL data
- Testing OSCAL - demonstrating the fitness and correctness of OSCAL models and rules on live samples, with known-good and known-bad cases for illustration
